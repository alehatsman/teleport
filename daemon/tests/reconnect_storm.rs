//! N4 -- reconnect-storm load test
//! (docs/15-open-questions.md#n4--reconnect-storms-and-reader-thread-contention).
//!
//! Catch-up ([04](../../docs/04-api-protocol.md#catch-up--register-late-not-early))
//! reads history off the same `Mutex<Fanout>` the PTY reader thread locks on every
//! `publish()`. N4's own text is explicit about what this file is and isn't:
//! bounding *one* client's catch-up (stalled-round / total-round ceilings) was
//! already closed by D1; what was never measured is many clients catching up
//! *at once* -- the shape of a reconnect storm after a network blip drops every
//! attached client on a multi-session host in the same second.
//!
//! This is a measurement, not a correctness gate with a number picked in
//! advance: N4 says "if it stays acceptable, record the number and close
//! this." So the hard assertions here are the invariants that must hold
//! regardless of how contended the runner gets (the control subscriber is
//! never disconnected, no gap/duplicate, no single `recv()` stalls
//! unboundedly), and the actual throughput/latency numbers are printed for a
//! human to read out of a real CI run's log -- same methodology
//! [W3](../../docs/15-open-questions.md#w3--pty_primitive_windowsrss-own-tests-were-oversubscribing-the-ci-runner)
//! used to find its own contention, not a threshold guessed at against a
//! runner this repo cannot reproduce locally
//! ([N5](../../docs/15-open-questions.md#n5--a-fast-producer-can-outrun-catch-up-on-a-slow-runner)'s
//! own lesson).
//!
//! `cfg(unix)`, not `target_os = "linux"`. It shipped Linux-only "for the same
//! reason `session_catchup.rs` and the N5 fixtures are" -- but that reason had
//! already been overturned four commits earlier: #29/#32 root-caused those
//! gates to the queue bound's *count* half (wrong on Linux too, merely
//! invisible there) and un-gated all three to `cfg(unix)`. Rather than
//! re-guess, measured on real macOS hardware (Darwin 24.6.0, arm64): 20/20
//! green, 6.77-6.84s wall clock, storm/baseline ratio 0.966-1.094 -- no
//! measurable degradation, and nowhere near `STORM_CLIENT_TIMEOUT`.
//!
//! It ports because of how this fixture is built, which is worth stating so
//! the gate is not reintroduced by reflex: the hard assertions are invariants
//! (no disconnect, no gap, no unbounded stall), never a throughput threshold,
//! so there is no tuned number to re-tune. And N5's tiny-read behaviour never
//! reaches the measured window -- the trickle is one 1000-byte `printf` per
//! 10ms, which arrives as one 1000-byte chunk on macOS too (106 chunks /
//! 106,000 bytes, exactly 1000 B each). `yes`'s tiny lines only shape the
//! backlog phase, which completes before anyone attaches and which
//! `session_catchup.rs` already proves on macOS with this same 12 MiB
//! constant.
