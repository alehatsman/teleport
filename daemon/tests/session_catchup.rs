//! **The D1 gate.** Attaching far behind a session that is still producing
//! must complete -- no `1013`, no gap, no duplicate --
//! docs/04-api-protocol.md#catch-up--register-late-not-early and
//! docs/10-testing.md#2-sessionoffset-unit-tests.
//!
//! The failure this guards against is a livelock, not a crash: register the
//! subscriber first and it spends its whole queue buffering live output for
//! the duration of a replay it has not finished writing, overflows, and is
//! disconnected *before it ever goes live*. It then reconnects further behind
//! and fails again. An idle session never shows it.
//!
//! The convergence arithmetic is covered deterministically by the unit tests
//! in `session.rs`; this fixture is the end-to-end one, so it pays real time
//! to a real child.
//!
//! **This fixture used to depend on a wall-clock rate, and that cost two
//! wrong turns.** The control subscriber was killed by a trickle out-running
//! the queue bound during the catch-up window, which made the fixture correct
//! only inside a rate band: too slow and its own guard fired because nothing
//! was being reproduced; too fast and the *attaching* subscriber was
//! disconnected mid-catch-up for a reason D1 is not about. It was tuned
//! twice -- once by slowing the rounds, once by batching the trickle's writes
//! to take `fork` cost out of the rate -- and both times it passed locally and
//! failed on `macos-latest`, a runner nobody can reproduce. Chasing a third
//! calibration was not going to work.
//!
//! It is now driven by **bytes, not rate**. The child blocks on a read from
//! its pty until the test writes to it, then emits a `BURST` larger than the
//! whole queue bound. The control subscriber is registered across all of it
//! and never drains, so it is disconnected by construction on any hardware,
//! at any speed. Nothing here is calibrated against how fast anything runs.
//!
//! The trade that buys: the burst is drained to completion *before* the
//! catch-up walk starts, so the control dies just before the window rather
//! than inside it. That is deliberate. Letting the burst land during the walk
//! reintroduces a rate dependency in the other direction -- a producer that
//! out-runs the client for four consecutive rounds trips
//! `MAX_STALLED_ROUNDS`, `should_register` clamps and reports a hole, and
//! `support::catch_up`'s `caught_up` assertion fires. What the control proves
//! is that the register-first ordering is fatal; *when* it dies was never the
//! claim, and it is no longer load-bearing.
//!
//! The session is still producing throughout the walk -- that is the trickle,
//! which now only has to be non-zero rather than land inside a band.
//!
//! Un-gated from `target_os = "linux"` to `cfg(unix)` once the queue bound
//! became a byte budget
//! ([N5](../../docs/15-open-questions.md#n5--macos-pty-reads-average-14-bytes-starving-the-queue-bounds-count-half)).
//! The old count half is what this fixture used to reach: `tick\n` is 5 bytes,
//! so 256 chunks tripped at ~5 KiB -- on Linux too, not just macOS. Fixing the
//! bound removed that, which is why the redesign above shipped in the same
//! change rather than after it.
